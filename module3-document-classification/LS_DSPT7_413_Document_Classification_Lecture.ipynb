That means you're ready to combine and practice those skills in a kaggle competition. We we will open with a five minute sprint explaining the competition, and then give you 25 minutes to work. After those twenty five minutes are up, I will give a 5-minute demo an NLP technique that will help you with document classification (*and **maybe** the competition*).\n",

    "Sklearn pipelines allow you to stitch together multiple components of a machine learning process. The idea is that you can pass you raw data and get predictions out of the pipeline. This ability to pass raw input and receive a prediction from a singular class makes pipelines well suited for production, because you can pickle a a pipeline without worry about other data preprocessing steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Each time we call the pipeline during grid search, each component is fit again. The vectorizer (tf-idf) is transforming our entire vocabulary during each cross-validation fold. That transformation adds significant run time to our grid search. There *might* be interactions between the vectorizer and our classifier, so we estimate their performance together in the code below. However, if your goal is to reduce run time. Train your vectorizer separately (ie out of the grid-searched pipeline). "

For a given dataset, our goal is to find the algorithm that achieves close to maximum accuracy while minimizing computation time required for training. We ran a large number (~450K) of experiments across problems of different types (especially sentiment analysis and topic classification problems), using 12 datasets, alternating for each dataset between different data preprocessing techniques and different model architectures.

       "  'To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:\\n\\n  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people \\nin the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. \\nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \\nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \\ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \\nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \\nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \\nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \\ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \\ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can\\'t remember his name) \\nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \\nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \\nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \\nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \\nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \\nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \\nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \\nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \\nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \\nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \\nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \\nwhich may happen.\\n\\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \\nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn\\'t \\nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \\nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \\nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see \\nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\\tSo, Minnesota may end up \\ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tGo Sabres!',\n",

FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I \\nthink you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an \\nobservation...\\n\\nHowever, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of\\nchanging the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for\\nthe \\'casual fan\\'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names\\nbased on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice\\nand unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not\\nthink that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of\\npeople that are interested in hockey, so it\\'s a pointless exercise anyway.\\n\\nIf the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not \\ncentral to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is\\nwhether or not players like Orr who \\'contributed to the glory of the sport\\'\\nwould have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to\\nplay in.

       "  '\\n\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station\\nwith a very exactly known position computes the errors in the\\nincoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors\\nincluding atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time\\ndithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational \\nequipment to \"back out\" the errors in its position (since it knows\\nwhere it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a \\nbroadcast which is available to any number of relatively local\\nreceivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using\\nthe same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very\\nsimilar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the\\nreceiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference\\nunit.\\n\\nThe US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series\\nof coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will\\nuse existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately\\n305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals\\non different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers\\ncorrection signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system\\nwhich has stations all across the US.\\n\\nThe correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format.\\nAdvertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nJohn P.

OK ?\\nLet me try to explain what that tower is used to:\\n   -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.\\n         It has an hightech \"boiler\" but the rest is still verry verry \\n         conventional. And if you\\'ve already visited any condensation-\\n         powerstation you\\'l have seen the cooling towers too.\\n         If you look at any good book about thermophysics you\\'ll find\\n         a chapter about the \"CARNOT-process\" which describes how to\\n         get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason\\n         for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you\\'ve an\\n         temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one \\n         side and need to cool down the steam \\'till you get water\\n         again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the \\n         energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to\\n         let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and \"cold\"\\n         steam on the other side you\\'ll loose much more of the energy.\\n         And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of\\n         energy that carnot will give them.\\n         The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !\\n         The vapor you\\'ll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,\\n         because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in\\n         AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent\\n         radioactive pollution of the environment !\\n         \\n   -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-\\n         Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still\\n         verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere\\n         around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you\\'ll have lot\\'s of problems with\\n         the boiler\\'s steel. That\\'s because at this temperature the\\n         metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.\\n         This is only for BWR\\'s. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures\\n         up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental. \\n\\n   -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever\\n         possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the\\n         years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won\\'t be 0.75 mRem\\n         at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you\\'ll still have\\n         1.5 mRem.

I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.

It should also be\\nable to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)\\nand a dim screen (say, around 310 mv).  Oh yes, it also needs to be\\ncheap.  \\n\\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\\n\\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\\ncircuit would not detect it.   \\n\\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\\nonly 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the\\nvideo signals to make this work.  \\n\\nThere are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require \\nsplit supplies.

       "  ': My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112\\n: to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, just\\n: wide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.\\n\\n: I\\'m a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if there\\n: are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.\\n\\n: My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver \"back\\n: end\" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I\\'m\\n: particularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do any\\n: current chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so a\\n: normal IF filter can be used?\\n\\n: Any suggestions?\\n\\n: John\\n\\n  What you describe is very close to what I built and described in the\\n10th ARRL Computer Network Conference proceedings.\\n\\n  I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially\\ndouble conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz.\\nThe receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used\\npreviouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham\\nRadio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.\\n\\n  The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used\\nat these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design\\nof this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).\\n\\n  While using this would have let me reduce the \"external\" IF count on\\nreceive, it didn\\'t really offer all that much help on transmit so I\\ndidn\\'t bother with it.\\n\\n  The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2\\nMHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios\\nactually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and\\nspeed is pretty much a function of filter design.

One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had\\nfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,\\nand he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was\\nthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.\\n\\nNow, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or\\nnear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me\\nfrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my\\nspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar\\ndetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which\\nis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to\\nobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.\\n\\nFor my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only\\nworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave\\nenlightment may be necessary.\\n\\nSo, the questions are -\\n  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?\\n  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by\\n  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector\\n  antenna?\\n  Are any brands \"quieter\" than others?',\n",

       "  'Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of\\napprox. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off\\nif an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more\\nfuel to the flame!\\n\\n1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though\\nLopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still\\nrecovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),\\nand there were questions as to whether he would be\\nable to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.\\n\\nI was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez\\ncan hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was\\nthe Braves \"Defensive Catcher\" prospect, while Brian Deak was\\nthe Braves \"Offensive Catcher\" prospect.  Besides, Olson\\nand Berryhill couldn\\'t hit their way out of a wet cardboard\\nbox, and don\\'t walk enough to be useful.\\n\\nBut Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went\\nwith the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down\\nat the start of the season, he wouldn\\'t have gotten his job back.\\n\\n2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.\\nAfter all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and\\ntear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher\\n(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to\\nmove Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.\\nPlus, you\\'d have to eat that salary, which isn\\'t huge, but isn\\'t\\ntiddleywinks either (I think Olson\\'s at about $800,000, Berryhill\\nat $450,000, but that\\'s only what I recall).\\n\\n3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to\\nplay in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players\\naren\\'t eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster\\nthe longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,\\nbut the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business\\nstandpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the\\nfirst time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.\\n\\n4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn\\'t on the team.\\nI still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,\\nand the truth is that I\\'d rather see our best team on the field,\\nwhich, IMO, includes Lopez.\\n\\nOf course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won\\'t need him. ;)\\n\\nAs for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went\\nlike this:  (Remember, they\\'ve BOTH been GM\\'s)\\n(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)\\n\\nCox:  OK, we\\'ve sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a\\nlittle smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding\\nis better than it used to be.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion\\njust won\\'t sign that baseball only contract.  We can\\'t count\\non him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the\\ndefense.  Besides, Gorman\\'s not ready to give up on\\nBilly Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher\\'s gone AND Deion signs,\\nwe can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to\\ngive us some pitching depth in 1995.\\n\\nCox:  Yep, that\\'ll be nice.  Too bad Deion won\\'t sign.\\nOK, I\\'ll look for Nieves when Justice starts having\\nBerry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about\\nKlesko?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Well, we\\'ve still got to fork out another 1.5 mil\\nfor Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money\\nor Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,\\nbut somehow he doesn\\'t seem to be the same GM.  First\\nJeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he\\ngets rid of Brian Jordan, then I\\'d HAVE to believe that he\\nand Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!\\n\\nCox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I\\'ll wait til the trading\\ndeadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few\\nextra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...\\nif Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, then perhaps Sid\\'s knees\\ncould be \"persuaded\" to act up.  There\\'s always the\\n15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  What about Caraballo?\\n\\nCox:  Well, he\\'s not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts\\nin Richmond, he\\'ll start walking more.  Besides, if he\\'s going to be\\narbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually\\nget some value from him before he makes the big bucks.\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Now, let\\'s see.  That leaves Lopez.\\n\\nCox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn\\'t think Olson\\nwould recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into\\nrunning into him again?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he\\'ll get\\n$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one\\nextra year.  Besides, until Olson\\'s shown his stuff a little\\nbit, I can\\'t trade him.  Besides, Berryhill\\'s a left-handed\\nhitter.  You know how rare that is?\\n\\nCox:  Don\\'t you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,\\nif you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in\\nthe World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Hey, you\\'re the one who wouldn\\'t write Lopez\\ninto the lineup.\\n\\nCox:  Well, you\\'re the one who went out and got me Jeff\\nReardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn\\'t be used\\nto our pitching staff\\'s stuff.  He got some time with\\nthem this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely\\nwe only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?\\n\\nSchuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep\\nwill be hurt by May.\\n\\nCox:  OK, OK, you made your point.

       "  '\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.',\n",

Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for\\ndoubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you\\nexpect lots of doubles and triples anyway.

It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.

Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).

       "  '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris\\' contribu-\\ntion  from the rest of the team\\'s.  There is only one way of determin-\\ning \"best\" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at\\nthe  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best\\nthat day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the\\nmost  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the\\nbest of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-\\ncess  used to determine the \"best\" is the score of the game and it re-\\nlates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method\\ninherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that\\nis how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.\\n\\nTo say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\nsolutely  that  player A\\'s team would have played better with player B\\nin their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.\\n\\nIf you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has\\ndone  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you\\nhave  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the\\nindividual\\'s  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the\\nonly measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-\\nball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-\\npionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-\\njective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can\\npredict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.\\n\\n\\nExactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with\\nClemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.\\nI am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally\\nmeaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on\\nhis ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to be rude.\\n\\n\\nFor you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point\\nof  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio\\nElenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because\\nhe   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed\\nthat in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an\\nindividual\\'s  performance   from that of his team\\'s for the purpose of\\ncomparing that individual\\'s performance with another individual\\'s per-\\nformance.\\n\\nThe stats are a nice hobby and  that\\'s  about  it.  There  is  no  new\\nknowledge being produced.

He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\\n\\n#4\\tJAYSON MORE\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nAfter being touted as the team\\'s top defensive prospects in training camp\\nbefore \\'91-92, More had a rather disappointing \\'91-92, as he was not\\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\\'s most\\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\\n\\n#5\\tNEIL WILKINSON\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB-\\n\\nWilkinson was probably the team\\'s top defensive defenseman in \\'91-92.  However,\\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\\n\\n#6\\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A)\\n\\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\\nbut he still finished as the team\\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\\'s abilities.  At the time, he\\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\\n\\n#19\\tDOUG ZMOLEK\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB\\n\\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\\'t show it (15 points).\\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.

       "  \"\\n<stuff deleted>\\n\\n\\nGood gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\\n\\nFor power:\\n\\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\\n\\nFor amplitude\\n\\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\\n\\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\\nconvention.

We had to turn down the volume!\\n\\nThe FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have\\nbeen shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the\\nfirst period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday\\nwhen they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that\\nhe was getting bored back there...\\n\\nMark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After\\nBuffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards\\nto Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead\\nto Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed\\nthe puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and\\nin on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his\\nstick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the\\nright past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and\\nGarry should turn down their assists :-).\\n\\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong\\nand kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive\\nstruggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when\\nTerry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into\\nthe boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not\\na terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got\\na post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.\\n\\nKeith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to\\ngive the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league\\ndidn\\'t allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a\\ngood scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards\\nthe end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept\\nmissing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give\\nthe Sabres another power play, but they couldn\\'t get anything going and the\\nfans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots\\nwere 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.\\n\\nMike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was\\ndisappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered\\na rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the\\nseason went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was\\nRuss Farwell\\'s trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed\\nSnider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they\\'d do\\nit all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for\\nnext year he said that it\\'s Russ\\' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the\\nend of the season. He feels that they\\'re 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.\\nHe expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title\\nthe following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based\\non the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.\\n\\nHe\\'s very happy with the re-alignment (he called it \"outstanding\"). Happy with\\nthe current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux\\nof Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.\\nSeemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there\\nwas a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in\\nfour years if there was a consensus.\\n\\nThe Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May\\ntook a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble\\ngetting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving\\nthroug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres\\nblue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed\\nacross to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the\\ntop of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling\\nthrough the slot. Fuhr didn\\'t know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the\\nrace to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.\\n\\nThen Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line\\nand went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was\\nall over it.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.\\nViacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when\\nBarnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer\\ntook a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln\\'t\\nget started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the\\nFLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and\\nheaded the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind\\'Amour hustled ahead to\\nmake it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top\\nof the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John\\nMuckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.\\n\\nBut the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to\\njust get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all\\nover them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through\\nSoderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that\\nmissed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as\\nhe skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.\\nMistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried\\nabout A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right\\nnext to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and\\nmistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the\\npuck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn\\'t even swing his\\nstick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks\\nend for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.\\n\\nLindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking\\nminor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get\\nset up quickly, but couldn\\'t get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued\\nto keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.\\nThings evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill\\nallowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a\\nfaceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of\\nhim. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and\\nthat meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,\\n7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.\\n\\nThe FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long\\nthey could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to\\nLedyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by\\nSoderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of\\nthe net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had\\nmoved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving\\nat the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net\\nat 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to\\nput it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.\\n\\nThe FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek\\nwas strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the\\nneutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS\\nblue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the\\nleft circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at\\n18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between\\nthe 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off\\nangles...\\n\\nThat was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.\\n\\nInto the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the\\nFLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in\\nthe slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until\\nhe had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he\\nhit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.\\n\\nThan an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood\\nuntouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under\\nSoderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,\\nhorn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange\\nreason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they\\ncould be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade\\nthat went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria\\nfor scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...\\n\\nDave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS\\ncould not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,\\nbut were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck\\nfrom a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across\\nto Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net\\njust inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,\\nbut twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing\\npuck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.\\n\\nBut the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive\\nleft corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate\\nout, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew\\nin, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom\\'s 5 hole for his 76th at\\n5:24 to tie the game at 4.\\n\\nThen Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up\\nin the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in\\nthe middle. While Brind\\'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the\\nline and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek\\'s glove side at 6:44.\\n\\nPlay started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.\\nThe FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind\\'Amour and Ledyard went\\nafter it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated\\nto the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing\\nthrough the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over\\nthe blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season\\nfor Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th\\nof the season.\\n\\nThen Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres\\npower play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the\\nchances on the FLYERS resulting power play.\\n\\nPlay went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to\\nmake some big saves. The Sabres weren\\'t able to pull Hasek as time was running \\nout as the FLYERS wouldn\\'t allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.\\nFinally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left\\ncorner and Brind\\'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found\\nDineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the\\nright of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton\\nchipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48\\non his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,\\nand the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the\\ngame.\\n\\nSo another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn\\'t been tested much\\nin his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night\\n(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don\\'t think so).\\nThe FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against\\nwith three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals\\ndespite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place\\nsince the Rangers lose the tie breaker.\\n\\nA couple misc notes:\\n\\nForget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to\\nannounce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.\\n\\nIn the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,\\nbut I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.\\n\\nThe Times of Trenton has reported that \"a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma\"\\nhas looked over Tommy Soderstrom\\'s medical record and determined that no\\nfurther tests are necessary in the near future.\\n\\nSame paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he\\nexpected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,\\nhe feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a\\nrole scouting if Farwell didn\\'t want him back.\\n\\nFLYERS team record watch:\\n\\nEric Lindros:\\n\\n41 goals, 33 assists, 74 points\\n\\n(rookie records)\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nEric Lindros\\t40 1992-93\\t\\tDave Poulin\\t76 1983-84\\nBrian Propp\\t34 1979-80\\t\\tBrian Propp\\t75 1979-80\\nRon Flockhart\\t33 1981-82\\t\\tEric Lindros\\t74 1992-93\\nDave Poulin\\t31 1983-84\\t\\tRon Flockhart\\t72 1981-82\\nBill Barber\\t30 1972-73\\t\\tPelle Eklund\\t66 1985-86\\n\\nMark Recchi:\\n\\n52 goals, 69 assists, 121 points.\\n\\nclub record goals:\\t\\t\\tclub record points:\\nReggie Leach\\t61 1975-76\\t\\tMark Recchi\\t121 1992-93*\\nTim Kerr\\t58 1985-86,86-87\\tBobby Clarke\\t119 1975-76\\nTim Kerr\\t54 1983-84,84-85\\tBobby Clarke\\t116 1974-75\\nMark Recchi\\t52 1992-93\\t\\tBill Barber\\t112 1975-76\\nRick Macliesh\\t50 1972-73\\t\\tBobby Clarke\\t104 1972-73\\nBill Barber\\t50 1975-76\\t\\tRick Macliesh\\t100 1972-73\\nReggie Leach\\t50 1979-80\\n\\n*More than 80 games.\\n\\nFLYERS career years:\\n\\nPlayer\\t\\tPoints\\tBest Prior Season\\nMark Recchi\\t121\\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\\nRod Brind\\'Amour\\t84\\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\\nGarry Galley\\t62\\t38 (84-85 Kings)\\nBrent Fedyk\\t59\\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\\n\\nThat\\'s all for now...',\n",

A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn\\'t understand this post, Rex,\\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\\n\\n--\\n    Keith Keller\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\\n\\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\\t\\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n\\nSorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for\\nKansas City, you\\'ll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having\\nplayed in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the\\n4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.\\n\\n\\nWell, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn\\'t quite\\naccurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,\\nwhich was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because\\nhe knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which\\npoint he disclosed the injury. Since he didn\\'t disclose it, the Sharks and\\nhe disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not\\nreporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as\\ninjured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped\\nhim down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly\\nnot with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a\\nno-no).\\n\\nVery nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was\\nhurt. I expect he\\'ll surface with another team at some point (probably\\nanother expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of\\nhis career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players\\nmotivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a\\nbad judgement call.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but\\nhustle isn\\'t always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me\\none night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to\\nhold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto\\'s\\nneck and another wrapped around Otto\\'s stick arm. Otto casually turned\\naround and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter\\nwasn\\'t there. Hustle can only cover size so far.\\n\\nThe Sharks have told me, point blank, that he\\'s gone for good (ditto HUbie\\nMcDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me\\n\"you have to make room for the kids\". Carter, in fact, refused to report to\\nK.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto\\nretirement, but I haven\\'t heard anything official. His only hope in hockey\\nnow is the Gulls.\\n\\n\\n\\nBecause, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked\\nfairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn\\'t think he\\nwas quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.\\n\\n\\nAgreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you\\nwish they\\'d performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you\\ncan really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have\\ntrouble, since you don\\'t see the off-puck action. your views from home and\\nmy views from the ice differ in numerous ways)\\n\\n\\n\\nCoffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou? Nah... \\n\\nHe was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as\\nfew games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate\\nto judge the talent too quickly.

       "  'Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. \\nThe Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles\\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \\nI\\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\\nreferee doesn\\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \\nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\\'t deserve to win in the first place.\\n\\nJust My Honest Opinion,',\n",

It is very unlikely, however,\\n   that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs\\n\\nNot possible either.  You\\'d need about a 300 amp alternator for\\njust the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow\\ndown on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.\\n\\n   for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt\\n   radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet \\n   away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.\\n   If you experience the problem frequently, it may be \\n   caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station\\n   nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio \\n   transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,\\n   etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are\\n   correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.\\n\\n   If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite\\n   chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably\\n   being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can\\n   be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).\\n   Good instructions are included with the chokes.\\n   If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your\\n   neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof\\n   or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things\\n   a radio operator can do to reduce interference.\\n\\nAnd please remember to be friendly when approaching your\\nlocal radio operator.  This person may or may not be the \\ncause of your troubles,  and you\\'ll get better cooperation\\nand help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most\\nare).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes\\ndealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost\\npictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b.\\ninterferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.  \\n\\nBTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or\\nnot he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of\\nbeing a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it.\\nToo bad they don\\'t require the consumer equipment makers\\nto take any precautions.\\n\\nLast, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are\\nrequired to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more\\nthan 10).  So if you hear \"This is WA1QT\" or some other call starting\\nwith A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham.\\nCB\\'ers probably won\\'t sign (I don\\'t know that they\\'re even required\\nto) and fire/police have other private ids.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have\\naffected the AHL this year.\\n\\n\\nST JOHN\\'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS\\nThe St John\\'s Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by\\nproblems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated\\npredicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This \\ncompletely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 \\ncould do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd\\ntake that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to\\nthe data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.\\n\\nI've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that\\nI've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and\\nb) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.\\nThat gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't \\nhave team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you\\nrun a simple least squares fit to the data you get \\n\\n(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.\\n\\nThe correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is\\nsignificant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the\\nfit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to \\nthe player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,\\nOzzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to \\nadd quite a few more during my copious free time this year.\\n\\nIt doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the\\nlow HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it\\ncould just be Ozzie.

They guy only had a couple of years were he\\ncould hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not\\nthink he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the\\ngame. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I\\nstill would not back him for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nDave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several\\nseason where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are\\n(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a\\nbit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other\\npeople but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial\\ncontributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are\\nsome of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he\\nwas with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to\\nand while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I\\nthink it deserves some consideration.\\n\\nLee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would\\ndeserve to go before the likes of Kingman.\\n\\nDarrell Evans - No.\\n\\nEddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although\\na silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not\\nsure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both\\nthe average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just\\nthink, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.\\n\\nJeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the\\ntop of my head I would take Lee Smith first.\\n\\n\\nWell, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I\\ntalked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been\\ninstumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very\\ngood offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers\\noffensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for\\nevery run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have\\nshattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved\\ngames? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nBoth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does\\nGeorge Brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n\\nSteve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone\\nmaking a case for him. \\n\\nJack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might\\nbring up his name.\\n\\nKirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still\\nhas time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my\\nprobably will turn into a definately.\\n\\nNolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him\\nhaving some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not\\nhear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the\\ncontributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would\\nnot say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even\\ntop 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame\\nbecause of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -\\neven with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL\\nthe possible votes.\\n\\nSo in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do\\nbut I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least\\nnot without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.\\n\\nYes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan\\nMaybe - Murray and L. Smith\\nNo - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman\\n\\nAs I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this\\nup - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.\",\n",

It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\",\n",

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \\nassistant general counsel. He became the league\\'s chief legal officer in \\nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

       "  \"I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when I\\ncame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for cooling\\ncomponents.

I never, ever thought that anyone\\nwould argue that Jagr\\'s higher +/- actually reflected better two-way\\nplay.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Francis\\'s low +/- is purely a result of him being asked\\nto play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he\\ncan chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team\\'s top center\\nis a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

       "  \": I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauch's\\n: ineptitude in managing the pitching staff.  Down the stretch, he\\n: abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those\\n: are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some\\n: time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season,\\n: obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh\\n: well.\\n\\nRoberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a\\nColt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace.\\nDennis Bennett was the 4th starter.\\n\\nThey were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two\\ngames after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory\\n(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the\\ntitle; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the\\nGiants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead\\nagainst the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way\\ntie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they\\nscored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.\\n--\",\n",

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\\n\\n#10\\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\\n\\t\\tpick in \\'92 entry draft from Vancouver\\nGrade:\\t\\tA/A-\\n\\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\\nhis small size (5\\' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\\n\\n#15\\tDAVID BRUCE\\t\\tSeason: 5th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a banner \\'91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\\nshort in the Sharks\\' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\\n\\n#18\\tMARK PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason:\\t3rd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers\\' decision to unload Pederson,\\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he\\'s not considered a\\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\\n\\n#20\\tJOHN CARTER\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from Boston\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\\n\\n#28\\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+/B)\\n\\nI don\\'t understand why the Sharks didn\\'t let Quintin play any more than the\\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\\ncamp before the \\'91-92 season limited Quintin, the team\\'s leading scorer in\\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\\n\\n#41\\tMARK BEAUFAIT\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\\nalthough it\\'s too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\\nKansas City.\\n\\n#42\\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\\n\\n#44\\tMICHEL PICARD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B-/C+)\\n\\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks\\' bait in the\\nexpansion draft.\\n\\n#45\\tDODY WOOD\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn\\'t give a grade at all)\\n\\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He\\'s not ready, and needs at\\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5\\' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.',\n",

He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount\\naround deflection coil of interfering monitor. \\nBE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH\\nVOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T\\nBLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO\\nMOUNT CAN.\\nNow, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also\\ngood at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on\\nmonitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other\\nsources.\",\n",

       "  '1992-93 Los Angeles Kings notes.\\n--------------------------------\\nPlayoffs:\\n---------\\n*Stauber disturbed by third-man theme\\nby Rick Sadowski, Daily News\\n\\nBarry Melrose\\'s decision to stick Robb Stauber in the stands rather than in the\\ncrease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with\\nthe rookie goaltender.\\n\\n\"I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most\\nfun time of the year, and I\\'m not,\"  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  \"I\\nthink I have worked hard enough for that.\"\\n\\nStauber said he accepts Melrose\\'s choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie\\nin their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

       "  \"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\\n\\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\\n\\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\\n\\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \\nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\\nthe catch.\\n\\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \\nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\\nnine games.\\n\\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\\n\\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\\nof the fan.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

Ville Siren\\'s slap\\n shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi\\n scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal\\n put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.\\n The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo\\n made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,\\n during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.\\n Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to\\n Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered\\n the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund \\n skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.\\n Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line\\n where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn\\'t see the puck since\\n there was traffic in front, 4-3.\\n Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan \"the Shadow\" Nilsson. Stefan\\n and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to\\n Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.\\n Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only\\n 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone \\n with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja\\n made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.\\n The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal\\n late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,\\n showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck\\n and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer\\'s goal\\'s far side.\\n But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the\\n game\\'s final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow\\n angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.\\n\\n All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn\\'t the best.\\n Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period\\n to try no combinations.\\n\\n Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-\\n Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.\\n Stillman good on defense.\\n Some players aren\\'t good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner\\n hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson\\n will likely have to leave for NHL pros.\\n\\n Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the\\n Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn\\'t have a very good game, we\\'ve seen him\\n a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland\\'s starting goalie in the WC.\\n I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team.

       "  'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\\nStillwell would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kurt\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt\\'s 57.6% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Double\\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.015 Sandberg\\n .865 Alicea\\n .852 Thompson\\n .755 DeShields\\n .705 Doran\\n .678 *NL Average*\\n .656 Biggio\\n .602 Harris\\n .582 Randolph\\n .580 Morandini\\n .573 Lemke\\n .571 Lind\\n .336 Stillwell\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.838 Baerga\\n.812 Alomar\\n.811 Fletcher\\n.806 Whitaker\\n.757 Blankenship\\n.725 Miller\\n.718 Knoblauch\\n.708 Reed\\n.704 Bordick\\n.691 *AL Average*\\n.636 Kelly\\n.631 Ripken\\n.603 Reynolds\\n.602 Sojo\\n.555 Sax\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

       "  'I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment\\nof WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to\\nboth stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike\\nLupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the \\nbig name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance\\nHe did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he \\nhad Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  \\n  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:\\nMorning show:\\n  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, \\nand Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti\\nhad a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries\\nto copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on \\neither station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and\\nyou can\\'t get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.\\n\\n2PM to 4PM:\\n  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and \\nRusso(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided\\nin my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the\\nappearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which\\nare often hilarious.  \\n\\n4 PM to 7 PM:\\n  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like\\nMike Missanelli but I just can\\'t stomach Steve Fredericks.  \\nI know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he\\nwas at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly\\nhomer now.  I don\\'t listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there\\nis a game on that night, but you will see later for the \\nreason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.\\n\\n7 PM to Midnight:\\n  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes\\nEli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on\\ncharges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my\\nnerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go\\nnuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)\\nOn FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets\\nJets, or St. John\\'s basketball.  If the game is on the\\nwest coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course\\nI think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but\\nWIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.\\n(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the\\nIGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))\\nDuring the summer, it\\nis all talk on WIP.\\n\\n\\nOverall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with\\nthe exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and\\n12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.   \\n\\n\\n\\n            Rich',\n",

       "  '\\nMy votes (FWIW):\\n\\nTeam MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has \\n36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain\\nthroughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and\\nMark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than\\nMVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on\\nthe team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess\\nI place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.\\n\\nBiggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season\\nas a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+\\npoints. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming\\nfrom the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew\\nCassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and\\nPetrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23\\nand will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the\\nrole of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake\\nbounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put\\nup about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started\\nperforming better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, \\nalthough lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the\\nright side.\\n\\nBiggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77\\npoint season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started\\nthe season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,\\nsince he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).\\nCullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded\\nthe powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his\\nway out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left\\nto run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the \\nMaple Leafs offered to Hartford.

Both teams seemed a bit tense in the\\nopening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got\\ninto the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-\\nstanding team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record\\ntheir first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on\\npenalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play \\nand could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had\\ntheir problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10\\ntries.\\n\\nThe Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the\\nblue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the \\nFlames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-\\npected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse\\nin his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to \\nthe dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this \\nmorning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.\\n\\n1st period: \\n1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won\\nthe draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the\\npuck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the\\nfar side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He\\nput the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up\\nin \\'his office\\', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where\\nSydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the \\nhash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.\\n\\nMillen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\\npenalty killing.\\n\\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\\n\\nNotes:\\n------\\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\\n\\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\\n\\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\\n\\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \\ngames.

The \"established\" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.\\nThe  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team\\ncould successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did\\nwas formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-\\nolistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-\\ner  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly\\ndebatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-\\nbate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people\\nplayed hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe\\nand his pals showed up.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better\\ndefenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that\\nBruce Norris\\' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby\\nOrr\\'s  then,  in the interests of education, why don\\'t you take a poll\\nand find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don\\'t  have\\nto, do you?\\n\\n\\nSo you don\\'t feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember\\nthat  Vancouver  plays in the West division?  (Or Pacific, or whatever\\nother intuitively understandable moniker is chosen.)\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd of course you neatly deleted Jason\\'s  jingoistic  rant  about  the\\ngame  losing  its  \"Canadianization\".   Quoting me out of context does\\nmore to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is\\nclearly  progressive  and  is anything but \"biased, closed minded, ig-\\nnorant\".  Arrogant, I will grant you.\\n\\n\\nNice try John.  But for a flame to be truly effective you have to\\ndisplay  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your target\\'s\\nrespect.\\n\\ncordially, as always,\\n\\nrm \\n',\n",

If\\n\\tyou\\'re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don\\'t\\n\\tdo it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,\\n\\tor your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;\\n\\tmistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National\\n\\tElectrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).\\n\\tTo the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail\\n\\twith the electrical code, but we don\\'t quote sections\\n\\tsimply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we\\'re wrong,\\n\\twe invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!\\n\\n\\tThe NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the\\n\\tforce of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,\\n\\thowever, do not.  Check your with your local building\\n\\tdepartment (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in\\n\\tCanada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,\\n\\tyour local electrical utility may also have special requirements\\n\\tfor electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that\\n\\twe say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family\\n\\tresidences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial\\n\\testablishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different\\n\\trules.\\n\\n\\tAlso note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in\\n\\tsome parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary\\n\\tof the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.\\n\\tLots of things are the same, including voltages, line\\n\\tfrequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number\\n\\tof crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we\\'ve\\n\\tnoted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC\\'\\' or\\n\\t``CEC\\'\\'.\\n\\n\\tRemember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often\\n\\tsmart to go beyond their minimal requirements.\\n\\nSubject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the\\n\\tNational Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.\\n\\tIt\\'s revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.\\n\\tYou can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly\\n\\tat 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There\\'s the\\n\\tfull text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There\\'s an abridged\\n\\tedition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.\\n\\tAnd there\\'s the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized\\n\\tcommentary\\'\\' on the code, as well as the full text.  That\\'s the\\n\\trecommended version.  Unfortunately, there\\'s no handbook for\\n\\tthe abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --\\n\\tUS$65 plus shipping and handling.\\n\\nSubject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?\\n\\n\\tThe Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up\\n\\tof various government agencies, power utilities, insurance\\n\\tcompanies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.\\n\\tThe CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two\\n\\tor three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,\\n\\tthis standard and publishes a province-specific code book.\\n\\tSince each province publishes its own slightly modified\\n\\tstandard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA\\n\\tstandard itself.  In this FAQ, \"CEC\" really means the\\n\\tappropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is\\n\\tderived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th\\n\\tedition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th\\n\\tedition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an\\n\\tattempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.\\n\\n\\tThe appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical\\n\\tinspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In\\n\\tOntario, it\\'s Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn\\'t\\n\\toverly fat.  It\\'s about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I\\n\\thear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the\\n\\tequivalent NEC publications.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout\\n\\tthe province.\\n\\nSubject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?\\n\\n\\tIn most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.\\n\\tIn some, they\\'re not.  Check with your local electrical\\n\\tinspector.  Most places won\\'t permit you to do wiring on other\\'s\\n\\thomes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do\\n\\twiring in \"commercial\" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)\\n\\tare usually considered \"semi-commercial\" or \"commercial\".  However,\\n\\tmany jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial\\n\\twiring if you\\'re supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can\\n\\tfind one willing to supervise.\\n\\n\\tIf you do your own wiring, an important point:\\n\\n\\tDo it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better\\n\\tjob than an electrician will do.  After all, it\\'s your own home,\\n\\tand it\\'s you or your family that might get killed if you make\\n\\ta mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills\\n\\tand knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.\\n\\tIn this FAQ we\\'ve consciously given a few recommendations that\\n\\tare in excess of code, because we feel that it\\'s reasonable,\\n\\tand will impress the inspector.\\n\\n\\tThe inspector will know that you\\'re an amateur.  You have to\\n\\tearn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your\\n\\ttime doing as neat a job as possible.  Don\\'t cut corners.\\n\\tExceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely\\n\\tpicky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t try to hide anything from the inspector.\\n\\n\\tUse the proper tools.  Ie: don\\'t use a bread knife to strip\\n\\twires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector\\n\\twon\\'t like it, and the results won\\'t be that safe.  And it\\n\\ttakes longer.  And you\\'re more likely to stick a hunk of\\n\\t12ga wire through your hand that way.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t handle house wire when it\\'s very cold (eg: below -10C\\n\\tor 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types\\n\\tbecome very brittle.\\n\\nSubject: What do I need in the way of tools?\\n\\n\\tFirst, there\\'s the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few\\n\\tscrewdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you\\'re \\n\\tlucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved\\n\\tdevices) you need Robertson (\"square recess\") screwdrivers\\n\\t(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.\\n\\n\\tFor drilling a few holes, a 3/4\" or 1\" spade bit and 1/4\" or\\n\\t3/8\" electric drill will do.  If you\\'re doing a lot, or\\n\\tare working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2\" drill\\n\\t(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and\\n\\t3/4\" or 1\" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull\\n\\tyou through, so they\\'re much faster and less fatiguing, even\\n\\tin 90 year old hardwood timbers.\\n\\n\\tScrew-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you\\n\\tinstall your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws\\n\\twork well).\\n\\t\\n\\tFor stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or\\n\\tordinary wire cutters.  Don\\'t buy the $3 K-mart \"combo stripper,\\n\\tcrimper and bottle opener\" types.  You should expect to pay\\n\\t$15 to $20 for a good \"plier-type\" pair.  It will have sized\\n\\tstripping holes, and won\\'t nick or grab the wire - it should\\n\\tbe easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the\\n\\tblade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There\\n\\tare fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren\\'t\\n\\tnecessary, and pros usually don\\'t use them.\\n\\n\\tA pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends\\n\\tin constricted places.  Don\\'t use these for stripping wire.\\n\\n\\tYou will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling\\n\\tinside boxes and closing loops, but it\\'s better to form wire\\n\\tloops with a \"loop former hole\" on your wire stripper - more\\n\\taccurate.\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'re using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for\\n\\tremoving the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the\\n\\tend of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,\\n\\tand simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a\\n\\t\"zipper\", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn\\'t try to strip\\n\\tthe sheath with a knife point, because it\\'s too easy to\\n\\tslash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley\\n\\tutility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)\\n\\tcan be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility\\n\\tthat you\\'ll gouge the conductors.\\n\\n\\tFor any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it\\'s well\\n\\tworth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).\\n\\tHack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire\\n\\tor the insulation.\\n\\n\\tThree-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired\\n\\toutlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more\\n\\texpensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple\\n\\tvoltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated\\n\\twire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost\\n\\tabout US$ 10 at Radio Shack.\\n\\n\\tYou should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are\\n\\tdead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)\\n\\tand work well.  If you get more serious, a \"audible alarm\" type is\\n\\tgood for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I\\'ve been known\\n\\tto lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)\\n\\n\\tFor running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.\\n\\tOften, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or\\n\\ta length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.\\n\\n\\tElectrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent\\n\\twiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for\\n\\twrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap \\n\\taround the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination\\n\\tscrews - I don\\'t do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to\\n\\tprevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet\\n\\tthat has no cover plate).\\n\\nSubject: What is UL listing?\\n\\n\\tThe UL stands for \"Underwriters Laboratory\".  It used to be\\n\\tan Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent\\n\\tand non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment\\n\\tfor potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means\\n\\tthat the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements\\n\\tfor safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn\\'t necessarily\\n\\tmean that the device actually does what it\\'s supposed to, just\\n\\tthat it probably won\\'t kill you.\\n\\n\\tThe UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are\\n\\tpermitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,\\n\\tinsurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will\\n\\tlimit their liability in case of a claim made in response to\\n\\tthe failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in\\n\\tmany situations the NEC will require that a wiring component\\n\\tused for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.\\n\\tIndirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring\\n\\tmust be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or\\n\\toccupancy permits issued.\\n\\t\\nSubject: What is CSA approval?\\n\\n\\tEvery electrical device or component must be certified by the\\n\\tCanadian Standards Association before it can be sold in\\n\\tCanada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done\\n\\twith CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to\\n\\tthe UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is\\n\\trequired by law.\\n\\n\\tAgain, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved\\n\\tequipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the\\n\\tclaim.\\n\\n\\tIn Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC\\n\\t(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to\\n\\tbe more a liason group between the CSA and insurance\\n\\tcompanies.\\n\\nSubject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?\\n\\n\\tUSA: The following three books were suggested by our readers\\n\\n\\t    Residential Wiring\\n\\t    by Jeff Markell,\\n\\t    Craftsman Books,\\n\\t    Carlsbad CA for $18.25.

Knight authors and publishes a book called\\n\\t\"Electrical Code Simplified\".  There appears to be a version\\n\\tpublished specific to each province, and is very tied into the\\n\\tappropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,\\n\\tand is indispensible for Canadian DIY\\'ers.  It is better to get\\n\\tthis book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer\\n\\tquestions on the net ;-).\\n\\n\\tIt is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is\\n\\tavailable at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.\\n\\nSubject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and\\n\\tinspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more\\n\\tmundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not\\n\\tliking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections\\n\\tprovides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors\\n\\tor subsequent owners of your home don\\'t get killed or lose\\n\\ttheir homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.\\n\\n\\tMost jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your\\n\\thome, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a\\n\\tpermit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about\\n\\tthis.\\n\\n\\tIf fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at\\n\\tfault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage\\n\\tclaims.\\n\\n\\tIn general, the process goes like this:\\n\\t\\t- you apply to your local inspections office or building\\n\\t\\t  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or\\n\\t\\t  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is\\n\\t\\t  a good time to ask questions on any things you\\'re not\\n\\t\\t  sure of.  If you\\'re doing major work, they may impose\\n\\t\\t  special conditions on you, require loading\\n\\t\\t  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point\\n\\t\\t  they will tell you which inspections you will need.\\n\\t\\t- If you\\'re installing a main panel, you will need to\\n\\t\\t  have the panel and service connections inspected\\n\\t\\t  before your power utility will provide a connection.\\n\\t\\t  This is sometimes done by the local power authority\\n\\t\\t  rather than the usual inspectors.\\n\\t\\t- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before\\n\\t\\t  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a\\n\\t\\t  \"rough-in\" inspection.\\n\\t\\t- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,\\n\\t\\t  you will need a \"final inspection\".\\n\\nSubject: My house doesn\\'t meet some of these rules and regulations.\\n\\tDo I have to upgrade?\\n\\n\\tIn general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,\\n\\tthough there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some\\n\\tcases).  However, any new work must be done according to the\\n\\tlatest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major\\'\\' work, you\\n\\tmay be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all\\n\\tof your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.\\n\\nSubject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240\\n\\n\\tOne thing where things might get a bit confusing is the\\n\\tdifferent numbers people bandy about for the voltage of\\n\\ta circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V\\n\\tor another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same\\n\\tthing...  In North America the utility companies are required\\n\\tto supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.\\n\\tThis works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there\\n\\tare resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it\\'s not\\n\\tunreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped\\n\\tto 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially\\n\\tat the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number\\n\\tof reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,\\n\\tdifferent people choose call them by slightly different numbers.\\n\\tThis FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them \"110V\" and\\n\\t\"220V\", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will\\n\\tbe.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.\\n\\n\\tOne thing that might make this a little more understandable\\n\\tis that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V\\n\\tinstead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device\\n\\tis designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that\\n\\tlow.\\n\\n\\t208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between\\n\\tphases of a 3-phase \"Y\" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any\\n\\thot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase \"Y\"\\n\\tcircuit that\\'s 277V from hot to neutral.\\n\\n\\tIn keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended\\n\\tto run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...\\n\\nSubject: What does an electrical service look like?\\n\\n\\tThere are logically four wires involved with supplying the\\n\\tmain panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility\\n\\tpole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.\\n\\n \\tThe bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded\\n \\tinto the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes\\n \\tto the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where\\n\\tthe main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic\\n\\taction conductivity \"breaks\" (often between copper and iron pipe)).\\n\\tThis is the \"grounding conductor\".  It is there to make sure that\\n\\tthe third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire\\n\\tnormally carries no current.\\n\\n\\tOne of the other wires will be white (or black with white or\\n\\tyellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.\\n\\tIt is connected to the \"centre tap\" (CEC; \"center tap\" in the\\n\\tNEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It\\n\\tis connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often\\n\\tinside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected\\n\\tanywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.\\n\\n\\tFurthermore, there should only be one grounding system in\\n\\ta home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.\\n\\tThese will be connected together, or connected to the neutral\\n\\tat a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional\\n\\tgrounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house\\n\\twiring is unsafe and contrary to code.\\n\\n\\tIf you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually\\n\\tbrought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are\\n\\tnot connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one\\n\\tneutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations \\n\\t(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do\\n\\thave to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your\\n\\tinspector.\\n\\n\\tThe other two wires will usually be black, and are the \"hot\"\\n\\twires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as\\n\\twell.\\n\\n\\tThe two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each\\n\\tother.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,\\n\\tthe voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the\\n\\twhite and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.\\n\\n\\tSome panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.\\n\\tThis is either because the neutral and ground are connected\\n\\ttogether at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one\\n\\twire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some\\n\\trare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only\\n\\tservice).\\n\\nSubject: What is a circuit?\\n\\n\\tInside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.\\n\\tThese connections are then used to supply power to selected\\n\\tportions of the home.  There are three different combinations:\\n\\t\\t1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.\\n\\t\\t2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.\\n\\t\\t3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,\\n\\t\\t   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.\\n\\n\\t(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and\\n\\tlighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying\\n\\tpower to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they\\n\\toften have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several\\n\\tcircuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is\\n\\tusually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or\\n\\tair conditioners.\\n\\n\\t[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar\\n\\tto (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there\\n\\tare two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral\\n\\tand ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing\\n\\tthe neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead\\n\\tof four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.\\n\\tWhen connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles\\n\\tare required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but\\n\\tthe NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,\\n\\tand found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to\\n\\tlocal practice -- there are restrictions on when this is\\n\\tpermissible.]\\n\\n\\t(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,\\n\\twhite for neutral, and bare for grounding.\\n\\n\\t(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a\\n\\tbare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.\\n\\n\\tYou will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground\\n\\twire.  Since the white is \"hot\" in this case, both the NEC and CEC\\n\\trequires that the white wire be \"permanently marked\" at the ends\\n\\tto indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail\\n\\tpolish or sometimes electrical tape.\\n\\n\\tEach circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the\\n\\tpanel through a circuit breaker or fuse.\\n\\n\\tThere are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)\\n\\tor (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places\\n\\trequire this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is \"frame ground\",\\n\\tthe other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an\\n\\talternative to GFCI protection.\\n\\nSubject: \"grounding\" versus \"grounded\" versus \"neutral\".\\n\\n\\tAccording to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the\\n\\t\"grounding\" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green\\n\\tor bare wire.  The word \"neutral\" is reserved for the white when\\n\\tyou have a circuit with more than one \"hot\" wire.  Since the white\\n\\twire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the\\n\\tpanel, the proper term is \"grounded conductor\".  However, the\\n\\tpotential confusion between \"grounded conductor\" and \"grounding\\n\\tconductor\" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should\\n\\tnever use the bare wire as a \"grounded conductor\" or white wire\\n\\tas the \"grounding conductor\", even though they are connected\\n\\ttogether in the panel.\\n\\n\\t[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground\\n\\tseparately from the main panel.  Usually.]\\n\\n\\tIn the trade, and in common usage, the word \"neutral\" is used\\n\\tfor \"grounded conductor\".  This FAQ uses \"neutral\" simply to\\n\\tavoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use \"neutral\"\\n\\ttoo.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light\\n\\tswitch applications) neutral.  Not ground.\\n\\nSubject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?\\n\\n\\tFuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power\\n\\tto a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For\\n\\texample, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should\\n\\t\"trip\", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As\\n\\tsuch, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the\\n\\twiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the\\n\\tequipment itself won\\'t cause a fire.\\n\\n\\tFuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt\\n\\t(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby\\n\\tinterrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively\\n\\tfast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have\\n\\tlarge startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use\\n\\ta \"time-delay\" fuse (one brand is \"fusetron\") which will avoid\\n\\ttripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a\\n\\tspring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be\\n\\treplaced.\\n\\n\\tBreakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They\\n\\tusually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched\\n\\tinto position against another contact.  When the current flow\\n\\tthrough the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip\\n\\theats up and bends.  By bending it \"trips\" the latch, and the\\n\\tspring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave\\n\\tsimilarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to\\n\\ttrip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high\\n\\toverloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite\\n\\tnumber of times - each time they trip, or are thrown\\n\\twhen the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which\\n\\tdamages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in\\n\\tplace of switches unless they are specially listed for the\\n\\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tNeither fuses nor breakers \"limit\" the current per se.  A dead\\n\\tshort on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even\\n\\tthousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which\\n\\tcan often cause severe damage.\\n\\nSubject: Breakers?  Can\\'t I use fuses?\\n\\n\\tStatistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher\\n\\trisk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually\\n\\tdue to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts\\n\\tcorroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse\\n\\tbeing installed, or the proverbial \"replace the fuse with a\\n\\tpenny\" trick.\\n\\n\\tSince breakers are more permanently installed, and have better\\n\\tconnection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.\\n\\n\\tFuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When\\n\\ta fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting\\n\\tpath.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,\\n\\tmelted service wiring, through fires in the electrical\\n\\tdistribution transformer and having your house burn down.\\n\\tBreakers don\\'t do this.\\n\\n\\tMany jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit\\n\\tfuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new\\n\\tfuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special\\n\\tinserts to \"key\" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)\\n\\n\\tSome devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse\\n\\tprotection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse\\n\\tis there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the\\n\\tlabeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently\\n\\tinstalled motors.  The installation instructions will tell you\\n\\tif you need one.\\n\\nSubject: What size wire should I use?\\n\\n\\tFor a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,\\n\\tyou can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,\\n\\tthough, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid\\n\\tvoltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than\\n\\t14 gauge, though it\\'s stiffer and harder to work with.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for\\n\\tmore than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or\\n\\tganged with other wires in a place where they can\\'t dissipate\\n\\theat easily:\\n\\n\\t\\tGauge\\t\\tAmps\\n\\t\\t14\\t\\t15\\n\\t\\t12\\t\\t20\\n\\t\\t10\\t\\t30\\n\\t\\t8\\t\\t40\\n\\t\\t6\\t\\t65\\n\\t\\n\\tWe don\\'t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent\\n\\ton the application and precise wire type.\\n\\nSubject: Where do these numbers come from?\\n\\n\\tThere are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.\\n\\tThe smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When\\n\\tthe resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is\\n\\tmore voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need\\n\\thigher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in\\n\\tconduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long\\n\\truns.\\n\\n\\tNeither effect is very significant over very short distances.\\n\\tThere are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller\\n\\twire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most\\n\\tlamps.  Don\\'t try this unless you\\'re certain that your use fits\\n\\tone of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger\\n\\twire.\\n\\nSubject: What does \"14-2\" mean?\\n\\n\\tThis is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors\\n\\tin a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second\\n\\tthe number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but\\n\\tremember there\\'s usually an extra ground wire.  \"14-2\" means\\n\\t14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.\\n\\n\\t-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes\\n\\tthe white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In\\n\\tthe latter case, the sheath is usually red too.\\n\\n\\t-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.\\n\\tUsually carrying 220V with neutral.\\n\\nSubject: What is a \"wirenut\"/\"marrette\"/\"marr connector\"?  How are they\\n\\tused?\\n\\n\\tA wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that\\'s used\\n\\tto connect wires together.  \"Marrette\" or \"Marr connector\"\\n\\tare trade names.  You\\'ll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.\\n\\n\\tIn essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them\\n\\ttogether, then twist the wirenut on.\\n\\n\\tThough some wirenuts advertise that you don\\'t need to twist the\\n\\twire, do it anyways - it\\'s more mechanically and electrically\\n\\tsecure.\\n\\n\\tThere are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check\\n\\tthat the wire nut you\\'re using is the correct size for the\\n\\tquantity and sizes of wire you\\'re connecting together.\\n\\n\\tDon\\'t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or\\n\\tyour fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (\"linesman\") pliers,\\n\\tand carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes\\n\\tit\\'s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it\\n\\tgoes in the wirenut properly.\\n\\n\\tSome people wrap the \"open\" end of the wirenut with electrical\\n\\ttape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may\\n\\ttear it off during an inspection.  It\\'s usually done because\\n\\ta bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead\\n\\tof taping it, the connection should be redone.\\n\\nSubject: What is a GFI/GFCI?\\n\\n\\tA GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter\\'\\'.  It measures\\n\\tthe current current flowing through the hot wire and the\\n\\tneutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the\\n\\tpresumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other\\n\\tpath.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of\\n\\tan appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any\\n\\tof these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking\\n\\tthe circuit.\\n\\n\\tGFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,\\n\\tfor example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral\\n\\tleads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI\\n\\twouldn\\'t help.  All of the current that passed from the hot\\n\\tlead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the\\n\\tGFCI happy.\\n\\n\\tThe two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.\\n\\tOne is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed\\n\\t*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be\\n\\tprotected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices\\n\\tdownstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be\\n\\tcovered by a single GFCI outlet.\\n\\nSubject: Where should GFCIs be used?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase\\n\\toutlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6\\' of the sink, garages,\\n\\tunfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or\\n\\tjust about anywhere else where you\\'re likely to encounter water\\n\\tor dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,\\n\\tthose dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space\\'\\',\\n\\ttypically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and\\n\\tlaundry appliances.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there\\n\\tis no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or\\n\\tbasement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you\\n\\thave a dirt floor, garage outlets if they\\'re near the door to\\n\\toutside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tEven if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may\\n\\twant to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI\\n\\tbreaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI\\n\\toutlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in\\n\\tCanada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your\\n\\tfinished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?\\n\\tDo you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does\\n\\twater or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?\\n\\nSubject: Where shouldn\\'t I use a GFCI?\\n\\n\\tGFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don\\'t pose a\\n\\tsafety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run\\n\\tunattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,\\n\\tand sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs\\n\\tare sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that\\n\\tthe inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary\\n\\tcurrent imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most\\n\\tGFCI trips are real; if you\\'re getting a lot of trips for no\\n\\tapparent reason, you\\'d be well-advised to check your wiring\\n\\tbefore deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.\\n\\nSubject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?\\n\\n\\tFor most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the\\n\\tfirst device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with\\n\\ta built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI\\n\\tbreakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE\\n\\tbreaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one\\n\\tmajor exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch\\n\\tcircuit\\'\\' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),\\n\\tsuch as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you\\'ll need a\\n\\tmulti-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;\\n\\tthe cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on\\n\\twhat brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such\\n\\ta circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.\\n\\n\\tOne more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use\\n\\tan oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use\\n\\tlarge (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You\\'ll thank yourself for it.\\n\\n\\tIncidentally, if you\\'re installing a GFCI to ensure that one\\n\\tspecific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don\\'t\\n\\treally have to go to all of the trouble to find the first\\n\\toutlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet\\n\\tin the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But\\n\\tprotecting the whole circuit is preferred.\\n\\n\\tWhen you install a GFCI, it\\'s a good idea to use the little\\n\\t\"ground fault protected\" stickers that come with it and mark\\n\\tthe outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which\\n\\toutlets are \"downstream\", simply by tripping the GFCI with the\\n\\ttest button and see which outlets are dead.\\n\\nSubject: What\\'s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?\\n\\n\\tApart from their use in electronics, which we won\\'t comment on,\\n\\tand for certain fluorescent lights (they won\\'t turn on without\\n\\ta good ground connection), they\\'re intended to guard against\\n\\tinsulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of\\n\\tthe appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there\\'s an\\n\\tinsulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the\\n\\tground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly\\n\\ttrips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not\\n\\tgrounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if\\n\\tyou touch it while you\\'re grounded, you\\'ll get zapped.  Of\\n\\tcourse, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very\\n\\ttiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace\\n\\tungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).\\n\\n\\tThere are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In\\n\\tparticular, that applies to toasters and anything else with\\n\\texposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating\\n\\telectrode in a toaster, and you\\'re not grounded, nothing will\\n\\thappen.  If you\\'re slightly grounded, you\\'ll get a small shock;\\n\\tthe resistance will be too high.  But if the case were\\n\\tgrounded, and you were holding it, you\\'d be the perfect path to\\n\\tground...\\n\\nSubject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization\\n\\n\\tNowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the\\n\\tother.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)\\n\\ton one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.\\n\\tThis is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the\\n\\tthe shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to\\n\\thave an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).\\n\\n\\tMost 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.\\n\\n\\tThis requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right\\n\\tway around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the\\n\\tnarrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the\\n\\thot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.\\n\\tIf not, you can usually figure out which is which by which\\n\\tprong the terminating screw connects to.\\n\\nSubject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?\\n\\n\\tThe NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance\\n\\tcircuits\\'\\' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex\\n\\treceptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more\\n\\tthan 24\" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider\\n\\tthan 12\" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.\\n\\tThe circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except\\n\\tin the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits\\n\\tare in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,\\n\\tlighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6\\' of a sink *must* be\\n\\tprotected by a GFCI (NEC only).\\n\\n\\tSplit duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab\\n\\tis broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to\\n\\tthe upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.\\n\\tThe neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When\\n\\t\"carrying through\" to another outlet, the neutral must be\\n\\tpigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral\\n\\tconnection fall off doesn\\'t cause the neutral to disconnect\\n\\tfrom downstream outlets.\\n\\nSubject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?\\n\\n\\tThere must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to\\n\\tthe sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in\\n\\tthe light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.\\n\\nSubject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?\\n\\n\\tRomex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.\\n\\tSometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.\\n\\tThis is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside\\n\\tstud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject\\n\\tto mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are\\n\\twired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several\\n\\tdifferent categories of NM cable.\\n\\n\\tBX cable -- technically known as armored cable or \"AC\" has a\\n\\tflexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is\\n\\tfairly resistant to damage.\\n\\n\\tTECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic\\n\\tsheath.\\n\\t\\n\\tProtection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable\\n\\tis run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer\\n\\tsurface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25\" (CEC & NEC)\\n\\tfrom the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected\\n\\tfrom mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of\\n\\tmetal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.\\n\\n\\t[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored\\n\\tcable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,\\n\\tbut this is technically illegal.]\\n\\n\\tAdditional protection recommendations (these are rules in the\\n\\tCanadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague\\n\\treferences to \"exposed to mechanical damage\" in both the NEC\\n\\tand CEC):\\n\\n\\t    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage\\n\\t      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls\\n\\t      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.\\n\\t      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.\\n\\t    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces\\n\\t      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian\\n\\t      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet\\n\\t      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable\\n\\t      or NM cable in flexible conduit to \"jump\" to the appliance.\\n\\t      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.\\n\\t    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating\\n\\t      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by\\n\\t      means of a 25mm/1\" air space, or suitable insulation\\n\\t      material (a wad of fiberglass).\\n\\t    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1\\' of every box\\n\\t      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5\\'.\\n\\t      Holes in joists or studs are considered \"supports\".\\n\\t      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to\\n\\t      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,\\n\\t      it is permitted where \"proper\" support is impractical]\\n\\t    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.\\n\\t      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring\\n\\t      to the \"workmanship\" clause, but this seems more honoured\\n\\t      in the breach...]\\n\\t    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or\\n\\t      similar finish.\\n\\t    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.\\n\\t    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists\\n\\t      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more\\n\\t      than 1m (39\").\\n\\n\\tWhenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small\\n\\tplastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to\\n\\tprevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through\\n\\tthe insulation.\\n\\n\\tBX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by\\n\\tsolid wall coverings.\\n\\n\\tIn places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of\\n\\ta garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a\\n\\tUL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of\\n\\tfittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the\\n\\twire.\\n\\n\\tService entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.\\n\\n\\tIn damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will\\n\\tneed special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like\\n\\tvery heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of\\n\\tconduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground\\n\\twiring section.]\\n\\n \\tThermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be\\n \\texposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that\\n \\tpurpose.\\n\\n\\tMany electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through\\n\\tfurnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed\\n\\tby metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this\\n\\tis that if there\\'s a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses\\n\\tfrom burning insulation very rapidly through the building.\\n\\tTeflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.\\n\\t\\n \\tCanada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,\\n \\texcept that Canadian wire designations usually include the\\n \\ttemperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: \"AC90\" versus \"AC\".\\n\\tIn the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.\\n\\n\\tNOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes\\n\\tmost often.

The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box\\n\\titself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic\\n\\tboxes don\\'t use metal cable clamps.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable\\n\\tarmor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still\\n\\tprovide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also\\n\\trequires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.\\n\\n\\tThe advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for\\n\\tnon-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground\\n\\tconnection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other\\n\\thand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For\\n\\texposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.\\n\\nSubject: Junction box positioning?\\n\\n\\tA junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.\\n\\n\\tJunction boxes must be located in such a way that they\\'re accessible\\n\\tlater.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction\\n\\tboxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may\\n\\tget nasty.\\n\\nSubject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?\\n\\n\\tIn general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few\\n\\tcaveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage\\n\\trating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half\\n\\ta dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire\\n\\tback to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle\\n\\tconstraints as well.  For example, older house\\n\\twiring doesn\\'t have high-temperature insulation.  The excess\\n\\theat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the\\n\\tinsulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.\\n\\tSome newer fixtures are specifically marked for high\\n\\ttemperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your\\n\\tceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case\\n\\treplacing any devices is a real adventure.)\\n\\n\\tOther concerns include providing a suitable ground for some\\n\\tfluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and\\n\\tits mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy\\n\\tchandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box\\n\\tspecifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling\\n\\tjoists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available\\n\\tthat can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and\\n\\tmounted between the joists.\\n\\n\\tThere are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as\\n\\t\"pot\" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated\\n\\tceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.\\n\\tThe CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated\\n\\tceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a \"coffin\" (usually\\n\\t8\\'x16\"x12\" - made by making a pair of joists 12\" high, and covering\\n\\twith plywood) that doesn\\'t have any insulation.  (Yes, that\\'s 8 *feet*\\n\\tlong)\\n\\n\\tNEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3\"\\n\\tclearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.\\n\\tThe rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,\\n\\twhich means that a CEC-style ``coffin\\'\\' might be worthwhile.\\n\\tPresumably, that\\'s up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn\\'t\\n\\tactually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector\\n\\trequirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can\\'t get\\n\\taccidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown\\n\\tin later.]\\n\\n\\tThere are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and\\n\\tfairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are\\n\\tusually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat\\n\\tmore expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should\\n\\tensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.\\n\\tFollow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location\\n\\tfor the sensor can vary.\\n\\n\\tThere does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved\\n\\tfor use in insulation.  The \"coffin\" appears the only legal approach.\\n\\nSubject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?\\n\\n\\tThis usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is\\n\\tloose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up\\n\\tbeing more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with\\n\\trespect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can\\n\\tdestroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in\\n\\tsome situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions\\n\\trequire the stove frame connected to neutral).\\n\\n\\tIf this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately\\n\\tand have them come and check out the problem.\\n\\n\\tNote: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with\\n\\tlighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A\\n\\tloose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness\\n\\tfar longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.\\n\\nSubject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?\\n\\n\\tThree phase power has three \"hot\" wires, 120 degrees out of\\n\\tphase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors\\n\\tbecause it is more \"efficient\", provides a bit more starting torque,\\n\\tand because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows\\n\\t110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between\\n\\tany two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal\\n\\t220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the\\n\\ttwo hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.\\n\\n\\tBringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually\\n\\tridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you\\n\\twant to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to\\n\\tbuy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is\\n\\tpossible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have\\n\\ta \"capacitor start\" unit, or use a larger motor as a\\n\\t(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if\\n\\tthe motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to\\n\\treplace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop\\'\\' has an\\n\\tarticle on how to do this if you must.\\n\\n\\tNote that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using\\n\\tsuch a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.\\n\\nSubject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?\\n\\n\\tTheoretically, it doesn\\'t make any difference.  However, there\\n\\tis a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply\\n\\twiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times\\n\\tless power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also\\n\\tmeans that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor\\n\\twill get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the\\n\\tsmaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.\\n\\n\\tThis is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more\\n\\tthan 50 feet long.\\n\\nSubject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?\\n\\n\\tIt is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746\\n\\twatts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,\\n\\tit is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200\\n\\twatts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,\\n\\tso it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational\\n\\tefficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.\\n\\n\\tSome equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router\\n\\tmanufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far\\n\\tin excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a \"stall\\n\\thorsepower\" or similar.  That means the power is measured when\\n\\tthe motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.\\n\\tWhat they don\\'t mention is that if you kept it in that\\n\\tcondition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker\\n\\twill trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it\\'s drawing far\\n\\tmore current than it can continuously.\\n\\n\\tWhen comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This\\n\\tshould be on the motor nameplate.  If you can\\'t find that figure,\\n\\tcheck the amperage rating, which is always present.\\n\\nSubject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?\\n\\n\\tOlder homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead\\n\\tof the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety\\n\\tground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither\\n\\tthe NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.\\n\\n\\tThere are several different approaches to solving this:\\n\\t    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the\\n\\t       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect\\n\\t       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle\\n\\t       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.\\n\\t    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and\\n\\t       it\\'s continuous to the main house ground point, you can\\n\\t       run a conductor to it from the third prong.\\n\\t    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.\\n\\t    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug\\n\\t       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI\\n\\t       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI\\n\\t       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong\\n\\t       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,\\n\\t       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it\\n\\t       wouldn\\'t be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault\\n\\t       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected\\n\\t       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren\\'t\\n\\t       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath\\n\\t       on BX cable.\\n\\n\\tThe CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three\\n\\tprong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.\\n\\tLike caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.\\n\\nSubject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?\\n\\tShould the test button work?\\n\\n\\tWe\\'re sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,\\n\\tthat your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there\\'s\\n\\ta resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE\\n\\tside of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current\\n\\tthrough this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.\\n\\tThis is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn\\'t require\\n\\ta real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press\\n\\tthe TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:\\n\\tif the test button doesn\\'t work, something\\'s broken, and potentially\\n\\tdangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.\\n\\n\\tThe instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground\\n\\twire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The\\n\\tcauses may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the\\n\\tformalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never\\n\\ttested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,\\n\\tUL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device\\n\\tbehaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded\\n\\toutlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are\\n\\tlabeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician\\n\\twas surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require\\n\\tit, and promised to investigate.)\\n\\nSubject: How should I wire my shop?\\n\\n\\tAs with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all\\n\\tdevices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies\\n\\tthat you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the\\n\\tcircuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for\\n\\tthe major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or\\n\\tshop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have\\n\\tbig motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp\\n\\tbreakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles\\n\\twhich means you\\'d have to \"replug\" all your equipment.  Lights\\n\\tshould either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared\\n\\twith circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two\\n\\tseparate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a\\n\\tsituation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand\\n\\tRPM, while you\\'re groping in the dark for the OFF switch.\\n\\n\\tDo install lots of outlets.  It\\'s easier to install them in the\\n\\tbeginning, when you don\\'t have to cut into an existing cable.\\n\\tIt\\'s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each\\n\\tpoint, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same\\n\\ttime as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and\\n\\tplates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have\\n\\tobjects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit\\n\\twrong.\\n\\n\\tNote that some jurisdictions have a \"no horizontal wiring\"\\n\\trule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used\\n\\tfor working.  What this means is that all wiring must be\\n\\trun along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.\\n\\n\\tOther possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V\\n\\tcircuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.\\n\\tDon\\'t overload circuits, and don\\'t use extension cords if you\\n\\tcan help it, unless they\\'re rated for high currents.  (A coiled\\n\\textension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of\\n\\tthe same gauge.  Also, the insulation won\\'t withstand as much\\n\\theat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)\\n\\n\\tIf your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,\\n\\tyou should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop\\n\\twiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to\\n\\tequip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.\\n\\tIf you want to install individual switches to ``safe\\'\\'\\n\\tparticular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.\\n\\tFor example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to\\n\\thandle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy\\n\\t``horsepower-rated\\'\\' switches instead.\\n\\n\\tFinally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished\\n\\tbasements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And\\n\\teven if you ``know\\'\\' that you\\'d never use one of your shop\\n\\toutlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might\\n\\thave a different idea.\\n\\n\\tNote: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop\\n\\twiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.\\n\\nSubject: Underground Wiring\\n\\n\\tYou will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use\\n\\tspecial wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic\\n\\ttubing and possibly lumber (don\\'t use creosoted lumber, it rots\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion\\n\\tof lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is\\n\\tgenerally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically\\n\\tlisted for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,\\n\\tfittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion\\n\\tin water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And\\n\\tof course, don\\'t forget the GFCIs.\\n\\n\\tThe required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to\\n\\tjurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about\\n\\tyour specific situation.\\n\\n\\tA hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says \"buried power\\n\\tline\" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.\\n\\nSubject: Aluminum wiring\\n\\n\\tDuring the 1970\\'s, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became\\n\\tquite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,\\n\\taluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,\\n\\tand most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.\\n\\tWe recommend, even if you\\'re allowed to, that do not use it for new\\n\\twiring.\\n\\n\\tBut don\\'t panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum\\n\\twiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.\\n\\tAluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper\\n\\tinstallation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential\\n\\tproblems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as\\n\\t\"cold creep\".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When\\n\\tit cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes\\n\\tthrough a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each\\n\\ttime.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes\\n\\twhen in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance\\n\\tof the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/\\n\\toxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,\\n\\tmelt the insulation or fixture it\\'s attached to, and possibly even\\n\\tcause a fire.\\n\\n\\tSince people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move\\n\\tinto a house built during the 70\\'s, we will cover basic points of\\n\\tsafe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you\\'re considering purchasing\\n\\ta home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you\\n\\thire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring\\n\\tfor the following things:\\n\\n\\t    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to\\n\\t       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will\\n\\t       be stamped with \"Al/Cu\" or \"CO/ALR\".  The latter supersedes\\n\\t       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat\\n\\t       more expensive than the ordinary ones.\\n\\n\\t    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around\\n\\t       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be\\n\\t       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the\\n\\t       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug\\n\\t       up each connection.\\n\\n\\t       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the\\n\\t       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.\\n\\n\\t    3) \"push-in\" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.\\n\\t       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with\\n\\t       the proper screw connections immediately.\\n\\n\\t    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,\\n\\t       melted insulation, or \"baked\" fixtures.  Any such damage should\\n\\t       be repaired.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be\\n\\t       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the\\n\\t       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting\\n\\t       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be\\n\\t       connected together using special crimp devices, with an\\n\\t       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter\\n\\t       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless\\n\\t       you can rent the tool.\\n\\n\\t    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring\\n\\t       by means of a short copper \"pigtail\".  See (5) above.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped\\n\\t       (not nicked) wire etc.\\n    \\n\\tIf, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring\\n\\tshows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider\\n\\tthe wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,\\n\\twe suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,\\n\\tyou can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having\\n\\tthis professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.\\n\\tYou can do this yourself too.\\n\\nSubject: I\\'m buying a house!  What should I do?\\n\\n\\tCongratulations.  But...  It\\'s generally a good idea to hire\\n\\tan inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.\\n\\tNot just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an\\n\\tinspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor\\n\\tones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any\\n\\tminor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many\\n\\tplaces, we suggest you look elsewhere.\\n\\n\\tHere\\'s some hints on what to look for:\\n\\n\\tObvious non-code wiring can include:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls\\n\\t\\t- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without\\n\\t\\t  proper marking.\\n\\t\\t- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of\\n\\t\\t  a GFCI)\\n\\t\\t- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)\\n\\t\\t- Switched neutrals\\n\\t\\t- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines\\n\\n\\tCertain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one\\n\\ttime) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:\\n\\n\\t\\t- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps\\n\\t\\t   not properly terminated wiring)\\n\\t\\t- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are\\n\\t\\t  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when\\n\\t\\t  it\\'s *really* convenient ;-)\\n\\t\\t- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations\\n\\t\\t- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps\\n\\t\\t- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them\\n\\t\\t- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or\\n\\t\\t  ceiling\\n\\t\\t- Backwrapped grounding wires\\n\\nSubject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the years since Edison \"invented\" electricity, several different\\n\\twiring \"styles\" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you\\n\\tmay encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old \\n\\tmethods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.\\n\\n\\tThe oldest wiring system you\\'re likely to encounter is called\\n\\t\"knob and tube\" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with\\n\\ta cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural\\n\\tmembers (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).\\n\\tWire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections\\n\\twere made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping\\n\\twith tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,\\n\\tthe wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs\\n\\tdown the centre of each room, with \"taps\" off to each fixture.\\n\\tThe hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some\\n\\tcases K&T isn\\'t colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same\\n\\tcolour as the hot wires.\\n\\n\\tYou\\'ll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40\\'s.\\n\\n\\tComments on K&T:\\n\\n\\t\\t- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about\\n\\t\\t  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.\\n\\t\\t- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up\\n\\t\\t  very well.  Most K&T I\\'ve seen, for example, is in\\n\\t\\t  quite good condition.\\n\\t\\t- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.\\n\\t\\t- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with\\n\\t\\t  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,\\n\\t\\t  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.\\n\\t\\t- Sometimes the neutral isn\\'t balanced very well between\\n\\t\\t  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to\\n\\t\\t  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on\\n\\t\\t  any circuit.\\n\\t\\t- Building code does not permit insulation in walls\\n\\t\\t  that contain K&T.\\n\\t\\t- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be\\n\\t\\t  tricky.  Consult your inspector.\\n\\t\\t- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more\\n\\t\\t  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.\\n\\t\\n\\tSince K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn\\'t\\n\\tnecessary to replace it simply because it\\'s K&T.  What you should\\n\\twatch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and\\n\\tbe cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it\\'s perfectly\\n\\treasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on\\n\\tnew circuits using modern techniques.\\n\\t\\n\\tAfter K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type\\n\\tyou will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks\\n\\tmuch like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was\\n\\tused in the 40\\'s and 50\\'s.  Again, no grounding conductor.\\n\\tIt was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback\\n\\tis that this type of insulation embrittles.  We\\'ve seen whole\\n\\tsystems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at\\n\\ta touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.\\n\\n\\tThis stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if\\n\\tthe wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as\\n\\tmuch as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.\\n\\tA simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several\\n\\thour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink\\n\\ttubing.\\n\\n\\tAfter this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.\\n\\tIt\\'s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.\\n\\tThis stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn\\'t present a hazard\\n\\tand is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be\\n\\treplaced - it should be considered as safe as the \"modern\" stuff -\\n\\tthermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don\\'t abuse it too much.\\n\\nSubject: Where do I buy stuff?\\n\\n\\tTry to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their\\n\\tprices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or\\n\\tDIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety\\n\\tincluding the \"odd\" stuff, and have people behind the counter that\\n\\tknow what you\\'re talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable\\n\\tsales people.  They\\'ll give you much valuable information.',\n",

The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
